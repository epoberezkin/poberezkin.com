Since December 2021 I and a team of three engineers, some of whom joined in the summer of 2022, have been working on SimpleX Chat [^simplex] non-stop.

In summer 2022, when we were about to run out of money we committed to this project, I was fortunate to raise a small capital from several angel investors and from an early stage fund Village Global, who I managed to convince that the Internet is coming to a point when everybody wants privacy, and that SimpleX Chat will evolve into a mass-market communication solution that provides it, profitably, and is able to both solve a decade-old problem of technology businesses abusing the privacy of their users, and also create a large value for its shareholders.

We haven't announced it straight away, as we were very busy at the time, and the product was super-early and had lots of bugs, and there was such a small number of users, that it didn't matter.

This capital enables our team to work full time, and also to commission a security audit from Trail of Bits, one of the most reputable security consultancies in the world, that we published in November 2022.

When we announced this fund-raising in April this year, together with the release of v5 of SimpleX Chat that solved the problem of sending large files, by integrating XFTP protocol that we designed, the response from the users and observers was surprisingly polarized. While most of the users were super-excited about us raising the funds and being able to continue developing the product, there were some rare but quite vocal critics who were stating that _venture funding is incompatible with privacy and the need to make profit creates an inevitable conflict of interest with protecting users privacy_.

To me these arguments did not make any logical sense for many reasons, and I made quite a few replies on Reddit and Twitter on that subject, but given how widespread this false belief appears to be in the community of privacy enthusiasts and even experts, both real and self-proclaimed, I wrote this post to explain not only why the above argument is a logical fallacy [^fallacy], but also why it is highly damaging to the privacy community, and why real privacy is simply impossible without venture funding.

## Mythology of privacy community

### Myth 1: Venture funding is incompatible with privacy

### Myth 2: Making profit creates conflict of interest with privacy

### Myth 3: Privacy is only possible with non-profit organizations

## "Religion" of privacy community

### Only recognized non-profits can provide privacy

### You must do things in pre-scribed way

### You must not make profit

### Who are the "clergy" that benefits from this "religion"

## Reality of privacy

### Reality 1: Privacy is possible only if everybody has it

### Reality 2: Privacy is a product people are willing to pay for

### Reality 3: Commercial companies are best at creating successful products

### Reality 4: Venture funding is the best way to build large commercial companies

## QED: Privacy is impossible without venture funding
